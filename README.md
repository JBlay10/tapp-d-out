Tapp-D-Out is a web app that helps you keep track of your tab in nights out. When you create your account it will take you to your profile where you will be able to add your tab, keep track of your consuption through the night and how much you've spent. If you already have an account created you'll be able to see four of the most recent tabs and a dropdown menu with all the history.
